# App Store Submission Status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-21
**Branch:** `claude/elegant-hamilton-2x8akp`
**Status: Submitted, waiting on Apple review (up to 48h).** Build `1.0 (1)` uploaded and attached to version 1.0, "Add for Review" clicked successfully.

## What shipped in this build

1. **Sign in with Apple** (`src/api/auth.js`, `src/hooks/useAuth.js`, `src/pages/auth/SignIn.jsx`) — mirrors the existing Google OAuth flow: `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "apple" })`, opens the system browser on native, returns via the `com.halftimeapp.app://auth-callback` deep link. Satisfies App Store guideline 4.8 (required since the app also offers Google login). **Verified working on-device** (Patch's iPhone 17 Pro) after a Supabase config propagation delay on the first attempt.
2. **UIScene lifecycle fix** (`ios/App/App/SceneDelegate.swift`, `AppDelegate.swift`, `Info.plist`) — the Xcode 27 / iOS 27 SDK made UIScene lifecycle mandatory; the app crashed on launch without it (`EXC_BREAKPOINT`, "UIScene life cycle is required for apps built with this SDK"). Fix adopts `UIWindowSceneDelegate`, keeps the same `CAPBridgeViewController` root via `Main.storyboard` + `UISceneStoryboardFile`, and forwards `openURLContexts`/`continue` through the same `ApplicationDelegateProxy` the old AppDelegate path used — so the OAuth deep link still works under the new lifecycle. **Verified on-device.**
3. **`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` = false** in `Info.plist` — app only uses standard HTTPS, so this skips the export-compliance prompt on every upload (confirmed: no prompt appeared during this upload).
4. **Fixed `ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`** — a prior `cap sync` had committed Windows-style backslash paths (`..\..\..\node_modules\...`), which SPM can't resolve on macOS. Corrected to forward slashes.

Commits (in order): `1c22575` (Apple sign-in + Package.swift fix), `f5b7fc6` (encryption declaration), `52deb84` (UIScene lifecycle fix). All pushed to `claude/elegant-hamilton-2x8akp`.

## Apple Developer Portal config (reference, no secrets)

- **Team:** HalfTime Solutions LLC, Team ID `Y2Y42U7LZ6`
- **Bundle ID:** `com.halftimeapp.app`
- **Sign in with Apple Services ID:** `com.halftimeapp.app.signin` (separate identifier from the bundle ID, used as OAuth client_id)
  - Domain: `ewcipqfcqyoqtpqzoazx.supabase.co`
  - Return URL: `https://ewcipqfcqyoqtpqzoazx.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- **Sign in with Apple Key:** name "HalfTime SIWA Key", **Key ID `638WXF48UD`**. The `.p8` file itself lives at `~/Documents/HalfTime-keys/` on Jorge's Mac (outside the repo, never committed).
- **Apple ID used for signing/portal:** `developer@halftime-app.com`

## Supabase config (reference)

- Project ref: `ewcipqfcqyoqtpqzoazx`
- Authentication → Providers → Apple: enabled, Client ID = `com.halftimeapp.app.signin`, Secret Key = a signed JWT (not the raw `.p8` — this Supabase instance's UI wanted a JWT specifically)
- **⚠️ That JWT expires ~180 days from generation (around mid-March 2027).** When Apple sign-in mysteriously stops working around then, regenerate it: see the `node apple-secret.cjs` approach used in this session (script deleted after use — recreate from chat history if needed, or ask a fresh session to regenerate using Team ID / Key ID / Services ID above plus the `.p8` file).
- Redirect URL allow-list includes `com.halftimeapp.app://auth-callback` (shared with the working Google flow).

## App Store Connect

- App: "HalfTime — Season Ticket Po..." (full name in ASC)
- Version 1.0, Build 1.0 (1), submitted for review
- Reviewer demo login: `reviewer@halftime-app.com`
- Copyright and Content Rights fields were initially missing (contrary to earlier assumption that the listing was fully complete) — both filled in before submission
- Pricing: Free

## If Apple rejects or has questions

Come back to this file first. Known soft spots to check if a rejection is unclear:
- Native Google OAuth flow (`src/lib/native.js`) — was verified working on-device but only briefly; if Apple's reviewer flags Google sign-in specifically, re-test on-device with the exact reviewer credentials.
- The app declares iPad support (`Info.plist` has iPad orientation keys) — a 13" iPad screenshot was uploaded, but the UI itself is not iPad-optimized (just centered/scaled iPhone layout). If Apple flags iPad UX specifically, consider restricting to iPhone-only in Xcode's "Targeted Device Family" build setting instead of doing iPad-specific design work.
- Deep links for `/join/:code` and `/guest/:code` (universal links via `.well-known/apple-app-site-association`) are still marked as **not done** in `MOBILE.md` — unrelated to this submission but worth knowing if Apple's reviewer stumbles into a share link during testing.

## Environment note for whoever picks this up

This work was done partly from a cloud sandbox (no macOS/Xcode access) and partly live on Jorge's actual Mac via detailed step-by-step screen-sharing through chat. Anything requiring Xcode's GUI, the Apple Developer portal login, or App Store Connect must happen on the Mac — a fresh Claude Code session can prepare code/config changes and push them, but cannot archive or submit builds itself.
